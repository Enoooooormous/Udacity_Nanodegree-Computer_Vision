    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I did not change the CNN even though it would have been easy to try different architecture (be it different variants of ResNet or different models like VGG). \n",
    "For the RNN, I chose a LSTM cell because the sequence can be extended (regular RNN have only ~8 to 10 timesteps of memory). It is also the architecture used in most implementation i could find. I read that adding a bias of 1 the forget gate increase performances (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf) but I couldnt find a way to do that in Pytorch (if ever you have a suggestion that would be great). \n",
    "I chose to use only one layer because i ran a quick test with 2 layers and the model wasn't learning much (very slow). I should have probably changed some hyperparameters - like the learning rate for example but time and resources were a constraint.\n",
    "For the hyperparameters, here my thinking:\n",
    "- batch size: we do have a pretty big dataset so we can augment the batch size a little. By doing so we can fight against overfitting (the backpropagation is less \"noisy\") and speed up training. One problem with that is that it is better to increase the number of epochs (I guess it is always better to increase anyway), which I didn't do for lack of time;\n",
    "- vocab threshold: I experimented with a higher number (25) in order to fasten the training and lower overfitting but interestingly, the model wasn't learning that much and perplexity remained pretty high (~11). It surprised me as with less words I was expecting a lower perplexity --> only significant words would be committed to the vocab which would make it easier for the model to draw differences between them (therefore increasing the certainty on the next word to pick). What I think might have happened is that only the common words got committed to the vocab (like \"the\", \"be\", \"to\", \"of\" etc.) and less key words. Not sure that augmenting the dataset would have solved that problem (more reviews mean more words which means that their probability of being committed to the vocab increases if the threshold stays the same, which would defeat the reason of why I put a higher threshold). Maybe more preprocessing work on the reviews would have been preferable (in sentiment analysis for example it is common to remove the stop words and to lemmatize, but what would be the effect of that in captioning (captions would probably make no sense anymore). Therefore, I went back to a smaller value of 10.\n",
    "- vocab from file: true so we could use the vocab generated in the previous notebook instead of creating it on the fly.\n",
    "- embed size: it was a given based on the CNN;\n",
    "- hidden size: i found that number in multiple applications so I copied it. An increase in hidden size would have probably given better results but require a longer training time with more epochs. \n",
    "- num epochs: I first tried the models with just 1 epochs. The results were surpringly pretty good (not great, but caption actually made sense even though they were not describing the image very accurately). After tinkering, I chose to train the model over two epochs because of time constraint. I believe anywhere between 3 to 5 epochs would have been a good compromise between accuracy and training time (after that the gain on accuracy might not be worth the time - for our application in the nanodegree).\n",
    "- the other hyperparameters were set by default and changing them was not a really interesting thing to do (no impact on the model). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "I did leave the transform train as is for the following reasons:\n",
    "- the pre-trained model we used for the encoder is the Resnet network which was trained on input of 224. Resizing at 256 is fairly standard and allow for some cropping (down to 224) which builds a more resilient CNN (by adding induced variation we augment the dataset and make the model more robust). Though it would have been interesting to test without the cropping --> cropping minimize the impact of background, but background information can be crucial to image captioning: background can contain key elements for interpretation (a dinner vs a picnic for example);\n",
    "- The horizontal flip makes sense in image captioning (vs. vertical, which is more appropriate for object detection) in order to augment the dataset without changing the meaning of the caption (people are taking a coffee upside down);\n",
    "- Scaling doesn't seem to make much sense in image captioning though it might be very useful to augment the dataset if the scale factor stays (very) small (~5/10%).\n",
    "- What we could have done was to \"play around\" with the color jitter, padding and perspective. If i had more time i would have tried with a mix of the three (using RandomApply) to see if it improved the learning ability of the model. If it did not, i would try the color jitter and perspective on their own to see the impact.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "Same thing here, i chose to train only the decoder and the encoder embedding. I didn't want to touch any of the CNN weights to fully take advantage of the transfer learning and gain of training time. It could also be a way to fight overfitting (I did not add any dropout layers or batch normalization). Results should be acceptable as it is the same type of image that the model was trained on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I used the adam optimizer, mostly because this is the one i saw in most of the papers/blog posts/tutorials on image captioning, NLP etc. i looked at. It seems to be a good choice here because the advantages of Adam are said to be computationally efficient and appropriate for non-stationary objective (the way i understood this last part is that our objective, which is to caption an image, varies as the length of the caption depends on the image. I might be completely wrong on that interpretation though). "

If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
